## Tasks

To solve the tasks first you should read carefully both the documentation (i.e. `/** */`) and simple comments (i.e., `//`, `/* */`), but in short the following actions should be taken:

1. The solution code should be written between the comment lines which indicates it and the result should be assigned to the given variable:

    ```javascript
    // PLACE YOUR CODE BETWEEN THIS...
    resultVariable = 42;    
    // ...AND THIS COMMENT LINE!
    ```
    
1. In this task is to create the functions based on the documentation comments.

1. For tasks in the JS Basics module, you can create a separate folder (for example, js_basics_tasks) and place your code in that directory
